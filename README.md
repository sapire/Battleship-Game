## How to play
You are playing battleships against the computer.
At the beginning, you need to enter your name.
Then, before the game can start, you need to place all your ships.
You do so by clicking on the name of the ship and then clicking on the upper board.
You can choose between vertically and horizontally by clicking on the 'V' button.
After you have placed all your ships, you can begin attacking the ships of the computer (on the lower board).
At the same time, the computer is attacking your ships.
If all the tiles of a ship have been attacked, the ship sinks.
Whoever sinks all of his opponent's ships first wins, and the game is over when there is a winner.
